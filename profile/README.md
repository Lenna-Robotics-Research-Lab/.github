## ðŸ¤– About Us

Welcome! We are a robotics research team based in the Electrical Engineering Research Lab at **Iran University of Science and Technology**.

Our journey began in Summer 2022, and our early work on diverse robotics topics led to the creation of two key platforms:
-   A **Self-Balancing Robot**
-   An **Autonomous Mobile Robot**

Since Summer 2023, our main focus has been pioneering new solutions in mobile robotics, which has transpired into our flagship **LMRO project**.

## ðŸš€ Our Projects

Here's a look at what we've been working on.

### 1. LMRO Project (Main Focus)
* **Description:** An open-source autonomous mobile robot featuring a distributed control architecture. It utilizes ROS for high-level robot control and a real-time embedded board for low-level hardware management.
* **Status:** Completed / Archived
* **Repository:** [Lenna-Mobile-Robot-ONE](https://github.com/Lenna-Robotics-Research-Lab/Lenna-Mobile-Robot-ONE)

### 2. Self-Balancing Robot
* **Description:** Our exploration into dynamic stability and control theory, developed as the capstone project for the mechatronics course (Spring 2022) at Iran University of Science and Technology.
* **Status:** Completed
* **Repository:** [Lenna-Self-Balancing-Robot](https://github.com/Lenna-Robotics-Research-Lab/Lenna-Self-Balancing-Robot)
