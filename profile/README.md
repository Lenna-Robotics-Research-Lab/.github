## 🤖 About Us

Welcome! We are a robotics research team based in the Electrical Engineering Research Labs Center at **Iran University of Science and Technology**.  

Founded in Winter 2023, we began by exploring a range of robotics topics that led to the development of two core platforms:  
- A **self-balancing robot**  
- An **autonomous mobile robot**  

Since Summer 2023, our primary focus has been advancing mobile robotics through our flagship **LMRO** platform, with an ongoing **ROS 2** implementation known as **LMR2**.  

Lenna Robotics Lab has also expanded into teleoperation research, investigating control schemes for a **2‑DOF serial link teleoperation robot** under **time-delay** conditions.

## 🚀 Our Projects

Here's a look at what we've been working on.

### 1. Lenna Mobile Robot ONE (LMRO) Project 
* **Description:** An open-source autonomous mobile robot featuring a distributed control architecture. It utilizes ROS melodic for high-level robot control and a real-time embedded board for low-level hardware management. 
* **Status:** Completed / Archived
* **Repository:** [Lenna-Mobile-Robot-ONE](https://github.com/Lenna-Robotics-Research-Lab/Lenna-Mobile-Robot-ONE)

### 2. Lenna Mobile Robot 2 (LMR2) Project
* **Description:** An open-source autonomous mobile robot utilizing ROS2 Humble for high-level robot control and the same real-time embedded board and architecture used in LMRO project.
* **Status:** Under Developement

### 3. Lenna TeleOperation Robot 1 (LTOR1) Project
*  **Description:** A control scheme for a teleoperation robot with time delay.
*  **Status:** Under Research

### 2. Lenna Self-Balancing Robot (LSBR) Project
* **Description:** Our exploration into dynamic stability and control theory, developed as the capstone project for the mechatronics course (Spring 2022) at Iran University of Science and Technology.
* **Status:** Completed
* **Repository:** [Lenna-Self-Balancing-Robot](https://github.com/Lenna-Robotics-Research-Lab/Lenna-Self-Balancing-Robot)
