## ðŸ¤– About Us

Welcome! We are a robotics research team based in the Electrical Engineering Research Lab at **Iran University of Science and Technology**.

Our journey began in Summer 2022, and our early work on diverse robotics topics led to the creation of two key platforms:
-   A **Self-Balancing Robot**
-   An **Autonomous Mobile Robot**

Since Summer 2023, our main focus has been pioneering new solutions in mobile robotics, which has transpired into our flagship **LMRO project**.

## ðŸš€ Our Projects

Here's a look at what we've been working on.

### 1. LMRO Project (Main Focus)
* **Description:** [Add a 1-2 sentence description of the LMRO project. What are its goals? What technology does it use? e.g., "An autonomous mobile robot platform designed for indoor navigation and manipulation using ROS 2 and AI-powered computer vision."]
* **Status:** [e.g., In Development, Active Research, Completed]
* **Repository:** [Link to the GitHub repo if it's public]
* **Visual:**
    *It's highly effective to add a GIF or image of your robot in action here!*

### 2. Legacy Platforms
* **Self-Balancing Robot:** [Briefly describe the project, e.g., "An exploration into dynamic stability and control theory using an IMU and PID controllers."]
* **Mobile Robot V1:** [Briefly describe the project, e.g., "Our first-generation mobile platform for learning path planning and obstacle avoidance."]
